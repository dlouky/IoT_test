IoT Engineering Test 
1.	AA_device_credentials_generator.py: It defines the tasks that the device must execute through the device_function variable.

2.	AB_device_simulator.py: 
    a.	This script will be into each device. It has a device_id provided by the device factory. If a credential for this device exists into the device_credentials folder, it will download the json file where device_function is present. It recovers from the json all the tasks it should perform:

3.	AC_publisher_IoTHUB.py: This script will be in each device. It use the credentials present into azure_mqtt_credentials folder to connect to the IoT HUB. After a successful connection, it securely sends the messages generated by AB_device_simulator.py to the MQQT broker (endpoint).

4.	AD_suscriber_IoTHUB.py: This script will be in client (subscriber) machine. It securely connects to the IoT Hub through credentials presents in azure_mqtt_credentials. After a successful connection, it reads the messages send by the device simulator and save them into MongoDB (dabase= db_elastacloud, collection= collection_elastacloud).
